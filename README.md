# Analysis and Algorithm Design Assignment 1 by Ali Amr Madany 52-3186

## Overview

this file includes two main programming exercises: powering a number using two different approaches and finding all pairs of integers in a set whose sum equals a given number using the divide-and-conquer paradigm.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `powering_number.py`: Contains the implementation of the naive and divide-and-conquer methods for powering a number, along with the time complexity analysis.
- `sum_pairs.py`: Includes the implementation of Merge Sort and Binary Search algorithms to find all pairs of integers whose sum equals a given number, along with the time complexity analysis.

## Running the Code

To run the code for powering a number:

```bash
python powering_number.py
```

To run the code for finding sum pairs:

```bash
python sum_pairs.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above.
- No external libraries are required for running the code.

## Assignment Evaluation Criteria

- Fulfillment of the mentioned requirements in the exercises.
- Working code for every input.
- Asymptotic and real-time diagrams with relevant discussion in the report.
- Submission before the deadline.
- Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
